TODO list:
 x spawn new objeects in front of the camera
 x real time update, auto rendering with low quality profile, no texture cleanup at the beginning of the frame
 - app state serialization (camera, renderer, world, materials) to json, each json as a scene file
 x material unique id instead of pointer (better for serialization)
 - list of materials, add, edit, delete operations
 - persistence for materials, json again
 - ray tracing in one weekend part 3
 - transition to dx12
 - DXR tutorials and integration
 - new GPU

Scene ideas:
 - light bend by a sphere, focus in a spot
 - light bend by a prism (to implement: index of refraction depends on the wave length(color))
 - green light focused by sphere is mixed with red light focused by a sphere, both produce yellow
 - light reflected of a diffuse object seen on a different object
 - reflections of an object that is not on the screen
 - reflections of all above in a bigger mirror
 - global illumination
 - glass growing and focusing light in a point
 - glass pendulum throwing a light beam at objects
 - off screen source of light
 - changing glass ir, camera alpha, metal fuzz etc.
 - transition between perspective and orthographic views, done with camera alpha and glass ball as a lense
 - different rays counts for different screen parts
 - refreshing only those parts that changed (low ray count prepass, high ray count pass)
 - scale all vectors until you get out of floating point precision
 - grid of square glass tiles surface/texture behind it, lots of caustics


 Problems with imgui (immediate UI paradigm):
 - Input widget setting new value every character instead of when pressed enter or focus left
 - No panels nesting, drag and drop, snapping to window
